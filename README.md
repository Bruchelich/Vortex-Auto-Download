# Vortex-Auto-Download

My first project

Small unoptimised python script that automatically downloads all mods listed on a mod collection for free

keep in mind this is not going to be instant, it's still going to be slow, but now you can do other things while you download the mods and not have to worry about buying premium 


Python 3.2 or newer is required to use software

First run setup.exe and make sure it says "All required packages are installed." at the bottom of the terminal that opens 

lastly run Downloader.exe and press escape on your keyboard to start and pause the program. 

IMPORTANT : have ur main browser and Vortex on the same screen and it should look something like this before it can start automatically downloading
